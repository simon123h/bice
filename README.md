## Installation

This package is not yet published on PyPI, therefore you need to install it locally.

Download `bice` and install it locally using:

```bash
git clone https://zivgitlab.uni-muenster.de/s_hart20/bice
pip3 install -e bice/
```

in any directory of your choice. The installation is performed using `setup.py`.

### Requirements

The software depends on Python 3 and the following third-party packages:
`numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `findiff`, and `numdifftools`.
All will be installed automatically when installing `bice`.

## Tutorials

We have a first tutorial!

- [Heat equation tutorial](demos/notebooks/heat_eq.ipynb)

More will follow soon.
