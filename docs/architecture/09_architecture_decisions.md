# 9. Architecture Decisions

## 9.1 ADR 001: Use of arc42 for Documentation

**Status**: Decided
**Context**: Project was lacking a clear architectural overview.
**Decision**: Adopt the arc42 template for documenting the system architecture in Markdown.
**Consequences**: Structured documentation that is version-controlled and rendered via Sphinx.

## 9.2 ADR 002: Mermaid for Diagrams

**Status**: Decided
**Context**: Need for diagrams in the documentation.
**Decision**: Use Mermaid.js as it allows "diagrams as code" and integrates well with Sphinx.
**Consequences**: Diagrams are text-based, version-controllable, and automatically rendered.
