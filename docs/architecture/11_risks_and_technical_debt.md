# 11. Risks and Technical Debt

## 11.1 Identified Risks

- **Numerical Instabilities**: Some problems might lead to non-convergence of Newton's method.
- **Dependency Changes**: Changes in NumPy/SciPy API could break compatibility.

## 11.2 Technical Debt

- **TODO**: Incomplete analytical Jacobians for `ConstraintEquation` subclasses.
- **TODO**: Limited support for 3D finite differences.
